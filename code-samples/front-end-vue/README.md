ðŸ“¦ Schema-Driven Rendering You're using v-for to iterate over schemaFields and dynamically generate v-select inputs. This pattern is powerful for building configurable UIs â€” especially in admin panels or CMS-like tools.

Vuex Integration The use of mapState to pull fieldSchema and schemaFields from the store shows you're centralizing state and avoiding prop drilling. Thatâ€™s a sign of scalable frontend architecture.
