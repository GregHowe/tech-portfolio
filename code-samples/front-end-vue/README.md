### ðŸ§© Code Samples in Vue

This section showcases my frontend development work using **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, with a focus on dynamic component rendering and schema-driven layouts.  
The samples reflect my ability to build responsive, customizable interfaces that adapt to user input in real time â€” ideal for platforms like Core.Builder, where users generate commerce pages based on templates.

Key highlights include:
- **Schema-driven rendering** using `v-for` and `v-model` for dynamic form generation  
- **Centralized state management** via Vuex and `mapState` for predictable data flow  
- **Responsive layouts** using `v-row` and `v-col` for grid-based design  
- **Component modularity** for maintainability and reuse across the platform  
- **Integration with REST APIs** and backend services

These examples demonstrate how I combine frontend precision with architectural clarity to deliver scalable, user-friendly interfaces.

Core.Builder is the user-facing application of the Core system, and allows clients to author compliant sites, with automatic deployment:

<br>
ðŸ“¦ Schema-Driven Rendering You're using v-for to iterate over schemaFields and dynamically generate v-select inputs. This pattern is powerful for building configurable UIs â€” especially in admin panels or CMS-like tools.
<br><br>
Vuex Integration The use of mapState to pull fieldSchema and schemaFields from the store shows you're centralizing state and avoiding prop drilling. Thatâ€™s a sign of scalable frontend architecture.
<br><br>
Vuetify Layout Leveraging v-row and v-col gives you responsive, grid-based layout out of the box. Itâ€™s clean, declarative, and visually consistent.

<br><br>
ðŸ“¦ Modular Vuex Design The use of state, mutations, and actions in a dedicated brand.js file shows you're following Vuex best practices. It keeps the store maintainable and scalable.<br><br>
Async-Aware Action (loadBrand) You're fetching brand data via Axios and committing it to state â€” a clean separation of side effects and state mutation. This is ideal for onboarding flows or tenant-specific branding.

ðŸ“¦ This component manages a custom loading indicator for Nuxt page transitions and async operations. It supports granular control over animation state, success/failure feedback, and lifecycle cleanup â€” enhancing perceived performance and user trust.
Lifecycle Awareness The use of beforeDestroy ensures cleanup â€” a sign of disciplined component lifecycle management.

ðŸ“¦ This test suite validates schema-driven rendering of the DrawerSettingsPage component. It uses dependency injection to simulate real-world usage and ensures all dynamic fields are present in the DOM. The tests are structured for reusability and accessibility-first validation
