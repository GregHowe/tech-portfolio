# 🎯 Tech Portfolio – Richard

Welcome to my curated portfolio, where I showcase not just code, but architectural thinking, strategic decisions, and professional standards.  
Each section reflects my commitment to clarity, scalability, and developer empathy — whether it's backend orchestration, frontend integration, or documentation that speaks to both engineers and stakeholders.

This portfolio is designed for recruiters, senior developers, and technical leads who value clean architecture, maintainable code, and thoughtful communication.
