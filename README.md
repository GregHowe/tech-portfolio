# 🎯 Tech Portfolio – Richard

Welcome to my curated portfolio, where I showcase not just code, but architectural thinking, strategic decisions, and professional standards.  
Each section reflects my commitment to clarity, scalability, and developer empathy — whether it's backend orchestration, frontend integration, or documentation that speaks to both engineers and stakeholders.

This portfolio is designed for recruiters, senior developers, and technical leads who value clean architecture, maintainable code, and thoughtful communication.


## Table of Contents - 

### 🟢 Code Samples in .NET Core 

These repositories highlight my ability to design clean, scalable solutions across backend layers.  
Each sample demonstrates architectural patterns, exception handling, and component design tailored for real-world applications.

### 🧩 Code Samples in Vue

This section showcases my frontend development skills using **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.  
Each sample reflects my approach to building dynamic, reusable components that respond to user input at runtime — ideal for customizable interfaces and template-driven site builders.
These samples are drawn from real-world projects, including Core.Builder, where I implemented dynamic rendering logic for user-generated commerce pages.

### 📐 Architecture Diagrams for Distributed Systems

These diagrams illustrate how I structure systems for clarity, scalability, and maintainability.  
Each visual is designed to communicate technical depth to both developers and non-technical stakeholders.

### 📄 Case Studies from Real-World Projects

These case studies go beyond code — they tell the story behind each project: the problem, the solution, and the impact.  
They reflect my ability to think strategically, adapt to constraints, and deliver results that matter.
