## ðŸ§© Case Study 1 â€“ Migration from Legacy ERP to RESTful Architecture  
ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GregHowe/Migration-Legacy-To-RestApi)

### ðŸ§  Problem  
A legacy ERP system was struggling with performance bottlenecks and lacked scalability. Its monolithic structure made it difficult to maintain and extend, limiting the organizationâ€™s ability to evolve.

### ðŸ›  Solution  
Led the migration to a modular, service-oriented architecture using:

- **.NET 8 APIs** for backend logic  
- **Vue 3 SPA** for a modern frontend experience  
- **Docker Compose** for local orchestration  
- **Entity Framework Core** for data access  
- **xUnit** for automated testing

The system was restructured to support clean separation of concerns, environment parity, and scalable deployment pipelines.

### ðŸš€ Result  
- Significant improvement in performance and maintainability  
- Easier onboarding for developers due to clearer structure and documentation  
- Scalable foundation ready for future integrations and cloud deployment

## ðŸ§© Case Study 2 â€“ CommerceCircle: Loyalty Platform with Clean Architecture  
ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GregHowe/CommerceCircle)

### ðŸ§  Problem  
The client needed a scalable platform to promote customer loyalty through gamification strategies such as loyalty points, tiered levels, and reward triggers. The legacy system lacked modularity and flexibility to support evolving business rules.

### ðŸ›  Solution  
Designed and implemented a **Clean Architectureâ€“based solution** in .NET 8.0, with clearly separated layers and asynchronous event processing. Key modules include:

- **API Layer**: GraphQL-based entry point coordinating requests across layers  
- **Application Layer**: Encapsulates business logic and use cases (e.g., BillPayment, Referral, Transaction)  
- **Domain Layer**: Defines core entities, value objects, and enums  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles data access, external services (LoyaltiEngine, Wallet), and migrations  
- **EventWorker**: Background service for event-driven tasks like notifications  
- **Test Layer**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing across all layers

The system integrates with Azure Functions, Kubernetes, and external APIs, and supports CI/CD pipelines for scalable deployment.

### ðŸš€ Result  
- Delivered a modular, testable, and scalable loyalty platform  
- Enabled dynamic rule evaluation and multi-tenant event processing  
- Improved maintainability and reduced coupling between services
