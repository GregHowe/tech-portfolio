ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GregHowe/Migration-Legacy-To-RestApi)

### ðŸ§  Problem  
A legacy ERP system was struggling with performance bottlenecks and lacked scalability. Its monolithic structure made it difficult to maintain and extend, limiting the organizationâ€™s ability to evolve.

### ðŸ›  Solution  
Led the migration to a modular, service-oriented architecture using:

- **.NET 8 APIs** for backend logic  
- **Vue 3 SPA** for a modern frontend experience  
- **Docker Compose** for local orchestration  
- **Entity Framework Core** for data access  
- **xUnit** for automated testing

The system was restructured to support clean separation of concerns, environment parity, and scalable deployment pipelines.

### ðŸš€ Result  
- Significant improvement in performance and maintainability  
- Easier onboarding for developers due to clearer structure and documentation  
- Scalable foundation ready for future integrations and cloud deployment
